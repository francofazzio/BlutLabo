                            <h2>1956-1963</h2>
                            <p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s,
                                it was difficult to imagine a band
                                hailing from the relatively poor northwest
                                port city of Liverpool, England, could get a gig
                                in the thriving London music scene of the south,
                                let alone export their eventual homegrown success 
                                to a world eagerly opening up to the counter-culture movement of the '60s and the burgeoning phenomenon that was called rock 'n' roll.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A fateful meeting between two music-loving teenagers in 1957
                                is where it all began. Sixteen-year-old rhythm-guitarist Lennon,
                                the son of a merchant seaman, was performing with the Quarrymen, 
                                a skiffle (folk music blended with jazz or blues) band booked to 
                                perform at events at a church fete in Woolton, Liverpool.
                                While setting up their instruments for the evening performance, 
                                the band’s bass player introduced Lennon to a classmate, 15-year-old McCartney, 
                                who would join in on a couple of numbers that night and soon would be offered a
                                permanent spot in the Quarrymen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                McCartney, the son of a former band-member and nurse, would play his first official event with the group in October, 
                                but things didn’t go exactly as planned. “For my first gig, I was given a guitar solo on
                                ‘Guitar Boogie.’ I could play it easily in rehearsal so they elected that I should do it
                                as my solo,” McCartney said in the Anthology documentary. “Things were going fine, but when
                                the moment came in the performance I got sticky fingers; I thought, ‘What am I doing here?’
                                I was just too frightened; it was too big a moment with everyone looking at the guitar player.
                                I couldn’t do it. That’s why George was brought in.”
                                Harrison, the son of a bus conductor and shop assistant, joined the Quarrymen as lead guitarist 
                                at age 15. Influenced by rockabilly, his guitar licks would help shape the group’s early sound.
                                Though still performing as the Quarrymen, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison would go on to form the
                                core that would soon become the Beatles.
                            </p>      
                            <p>
                                Throughout 1958 and 1959 the Quarrymen gigged whenever they could, including local parties and
                                family events such as the reception for Harrison’s brother’s wedding. Professional bookings
                                included venues such as the Casbah Coffee Club in Liverpool and Hippodrome in Manchester.

                            <h2>1963-1966</h2>
                            <p>
                                Beatlemania was the name given to the popular frenzy surrounding 
                                the Beatles after the band's first appearances on British television 
                                in 1963. When the Beatles appeared on American television in 1964, it
                                also erupted in the United States. Mass media created the conditions 
                                for the collective frenzy that was Beatlemania.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In February 1964, the Beatles arrived in the United States and their televised
                                performances on The Ed Sullivan Show were viewed by approximately 73 million people.
                                There, the band's instant popularity established their international stature, and their 
                                unprecedented domination of the national sales charts was mirrored in numerous other countries. 
                                Their August 1965 concert at New York's Shea Stadium marked the first time that a large outdoor 
                                stadium was used for such a purpose, and with an audience of 55,000, set records for attendance 
                                and revenue generation. To protect them from their fans, the Beatles typically travelled to these 
                                concerts by armoured car. From the end of that year, the band embraced promo clips for their singles
                                to avoid the difficulties of making personal appearances on television programmes.
                                Their December 1965 album Rubber Soul marked a profound change in the dynamic between fans and
                                artists, as many Beatles fans sought to appreciate the progressive quality in the band's look, 
                                lyrics and sound.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 1966, John Lennon controversially remarked that the group had become "more popular than Jesus".
                                Soon afterwards, when the Beatles toured Japan, the Philippines and the US, they were entangled in
                                mob revolt, violence, political backlash and threats of assassination. Frustrated by the restrictions
                                of Beatlemania and unable to hear themselves play above their fans' screams, the group stopped
                                touring and became a studio-only band. Their popularity and influence expanded in various social
                                and political arenas, while Beatlemania continued on a reduced scale from then and into the members'
                                solo careers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beatlemania surpassed any previous examples of fan worship in its intensity and scope. 
                                Initially, the fans were predominantly young adolescent females, sometimes called "teenyboppers",
                                and their behaviour was scorned by many commentators. By 1965, their fanbase included listeners who
                                traditionally shunned youth-driven pop culture, which helped bridge divisions between folk and rock
                                enthusiasts. During the 1960s, Beatlemania was the subject of analysis by psychologists and sociologists;
                                a 1997 study recognised the phenomenon as an early demonstration of proto-feminist girl power.
                                The receptions of subsequent pop acts (particularly boy bands) have drawn comparisons to 
                                Beatlemania, although none have replicated the breadth and depth of the Beatles' fandom nor its 
                                cultural impact.

                            <h2>1966-1970</h2>
                            <p>
                                Freed from the burden of touring, the Beatles 
                                embraced an increasingly experimental approach 
                                as they recorded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, 
                                beginning in late November 1966. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, 
                                the album's recording took over 700 hours. He recalled the band's
                                insistence "that everything on Sgt. Pepper had to be different. 
                                We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and
                                headphones turned into microphones attached to violins. We used giant
                                primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and 
                                we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the 
                                wrong way around." Parts of "A Day in the Life" featured a 40-piece 
                                orchestra. The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side 
                                single "Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" in February 1967; 
                                the Sgt. Pepper LP followed with a rush-release in May. The musical 
                                complexity of the records, created using relatively primitive four-track 
                                recording technology, astounded contemporary artists.Among music critics, 
                                acclaim for the album was virtually universal.

                                In February 1968, the Beatles travelled to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram 
                                in Rishikesh, India, to take part in a three-month meditation "Guide Course". 
                                Their time in India marked one of the band's most prolific periods, yielding 
                                numerous songs, including a majority of those on their next album. However, 
                                Starr left after only ten days, unable to stomach the food, and McCartney 
                                eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, 
                                creativity turned to question when an electronics technician known as Magic 
                                Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When 
                                he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, 
                                a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, 
                                bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage 
                                with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled "Maharishi", renamed 
                                "Sexy Sadie" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, "We made a mistake. 
                                We thought there was more to him than there was."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In May, Lennon and McCartney travelled to New York for the public 
                                unveiling of the Beatles' new business venture, Apple Corps. 
                                It was initially formed several months earlier as part of a plan 
                                to create a tax-effective business structure, but the band then 
                                desired to extend the corporation to other pursuits, including record 
                                distribution, peace activism, and education. McCartney described Apple 
                                as "rather like a Western communism". The enterprise drained the group 
                                financially with a series of unsuccessful projects handled largely by 
                                members of the Beatles' entourage, who were given their jobs regardless 
                                of talent and experience. Among its numerous subsidiaries were Apple 
                                Electronics, established to foster technological innovations with Magic 
                                Alex at the head, and Apple Retailing, which opened the short-lived 
                                Apple Boutique in London. Harrison later said, "Basically, it was chaos
                                ... John and Paul got carried away with the idea and blew millions, 
                                and Ringo and I just had to go along with it."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the record, the band executed a wider range of musical styles 
                                and broke with their recent tradition of incorporating several musical 
                                styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful 
                                to a select genre. During the sessions, the group upgraded to an 
                                eight-track tape console, which made it easier for them to layer 
                                tracks piecemeal, while the members often recorded independently of 
                                each other, affording the album a reputation as a collection of solo 
                                recordings rather than a unified group effort. Describing the double album, 
                                Lennon later said: "Every track is an individual track; there isn't any 
                                Beatle music on it. [It's] John and the band, Paul and the band, George and 
                                the band." The sessions also produced the Beatles' longest song yet, 
                                "Hey Jude", released in August as a non-album single with "Revolution".

                            <h2>1970</h2>
                            <p>
                                Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, 
                                it was largely recorded before Abbey Road. The project's 
                                impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, 
                                who suggested they "record an album of new material and 
                                rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for 
                                the very first time - on record and on film". Originally 
                                intended for a one-hour television programme to be called 
                                Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content 
                                came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours 
                                of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg.
                                Martin said that the project was "not at all a happy recording 
                                experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles 
                                were at their lowest ebb." Lennon described the largely impromptu 
                                sessions as "hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth", and Harrison, 
                                "the low of all-time". Irritated by McCartney and Lennon, Harrison 
                                walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the 
                                band unless they "abandon[ed] all talk of live performance" and instead 
                                focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs 
                                recorded for the TV special.[267] He also demanded they cease work at
                                Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate 
                                to the newly finished Apple Studio. His bandmates agreed, and it was 
                                decided to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a 
                                feature film.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their 
                                live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate 
                                in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the 
                                "Get Back" single - the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment 
                                on an official Beatles release. After the rehearsals, the band could not 
                                agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including 
                                a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum.
                                Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the 
                                rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row, London, on 30 January 
                                1969. Five weeks later, engineer Glyn Johns, whom Lewisohn describes as Get 
                                Back's "uncredited producer", began work assembling an album, given "free 
                                rein" as the band "all but washed their hands of the entire project".

                            <p>
                                New strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment 
                                of a financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without 
                                Epstein to manage business affairs. Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured 
                                Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke; McCartney 
                                wanted Lee and John Eastman - father and brother, respectively, of Linda 
                                Eastman, whom McCartney married on 12 March. Agreement could not be reached, 
                                so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the 
                                Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers. Further conflict 
                                ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost. On 8 May, Klein was 
                                named sole manager of the band, the Eastmans having previously been dismissed 
                                as the Beatles' lawyers. McCartney refused to sign the management contract 
                                with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                McCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles' 
                                contractual partnership on 31 December 1970. 
                                Legal disputes continued long after their break-up, and the dissolution 
                                was not formalised until 29 December 1974, when Lennon signed the paperwork 
                                terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt 
                                Disney World Resort in Florida.

                            <p>
                                The English rock band the Beatles are commonly regarded as the foremost and 
                                most influential band in popular music history. With a line-up comprising 
                                John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they sparked the 
                                "Beatlemania" phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, 
                                and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of 
                                the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society's developments. 
                                Their recognition concerns their effect on the era's youth and counterculture, 
                                British identity, popular music's evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented 
                                following.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many cultural movements of the 1960s were assisted or inspired by the Beatles. 
                                In Britain, their rise to national prominence signalled the youth-driven 
                                changes in postwar society, with respect to social mobility, teenagers' 
                                commercial influence, and informality. They spearheaded the shift from American 
                                artists' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (known in the US 
                                as the British Invasion) and inspired many young people to pursue music careers. 
                                From 1964 to 1970, the group had the top-selling US single one out of every 
                                six weeks, and the top-selling US album one out of every three weeks. 
                                In 1965, they were awarded MBEs, the first time such an honour was bestowed on 
                                a British pop act. A year later, Lennon controversially remarked that the band 
                                were "more popular than Jesus now".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Beatles often incorporated classical elements, traditional pop 
                                forms and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways, 
                                especially with the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) 
                                and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Many of their 
                                advances in production, writing, and artistic presentation were 
                                soon widespread. Other cultural changes initiated by the group 
                                include the elevation of the album to become the dominant form 
                                of record consumption over singles, a wider interest in psychedelic 
                                drugs and Eastern spirituality, and several fashion trends. The band 
                                also pioneered with their record sleeves and music videos, as well 
                                as informed music styles such as jangle, folk rock, power pop, 
                                psychedelia, progressive rock and heavy metal. By the end of the decade, 
                                the group were seen as an embodiment of the era's sociocultural movements, 
                                exemplified by the sentiment of their 1967 song "All You Need Is Love".

                            <p>
                                Over the 1960s as a whole, the Beatles were the dominant youth-centred 
                                pop act on the sales charts. They broke numerous sales and attendance 
                                records, many of which they have or had maintained for decades, and 
                                continue to enjoy a canonised status unprecedented for popular musicians. 
                                Their songs are among the most recorded in history, with cover versions of 
                                "Yesterday" exceeding thousands. As of 2009, they were the best-selling 
                                band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide. 
                                Time included them in its list of the twentieth century's 100 most important people.

                                Paul McCartney, in full Sir James Paul McCartney, 
                                (born June 18, 1942, Liverpool, England), British vocalist, 
                                songwriter, composer, bass player, poet, and painter whose 
                                work with the Beatles in the 1960s helped lift popular music 
                                from its origins in the entertainment business and transform 
                                it into a creative, highly commercial art form. He is also one 
                                of the most popular solo performers of all time in terms of both 
                                sales of his recordings and attendance at his concerts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                McCartney’s father, James, worked in the Liverpool Cotton Exchange, 
                                and his mother, Mary, was a midwife, out at all hours on her bicycle 
                                to deliver babies. Her death from breast cancer in October 1956, 
                                when McCartney was age 14, had a profound effect on his life and 
                                was the inspiration for his ballad “Let It Be” (1970). 
                                His younger brother, Michael, later changed his name to Mike 
                                McGear and had a number of hits in the satirical rock group Scaffold. 
                                Like fellow Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr (Richard Starkey), 
                                McCartney grew up in a traditional north of England working-class 
                                society, with an extended family frequently visiting the house at 20 
                                Forthlin Road in the Allerton area of Liverpool (the house is now 
                                owned by the National Trust). His father had been the leader of Jim 
                                Mac's Jazz Band, and in the evenings the family often gathered around 
                                the piano, an experience McCartney drew upon for such sing-along 
                                songs as “When I'm 64” (1967). 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On July 6, 1957, he met John Lennon at Woolton Village Fete and joined 
                                his skiffle group, the Quarrymen, which, after several name changes, 
                                became the Beatles. When Lennon's mother was killed by a speeding 
                                police car in 1958, McCartney, with his own mother's death still 
                                fresh in his memory, was able to empathize with the distraught 
                                17-year-old, creating a bond that became the basis of their close 
                                friendship. McCartney and Lennon quickly established themselves as 
                                songwriters for the group, and, by the time the Beatles signed with 
                                EMI-Parlophone in 1962, they were writing most of their own material. 
                                By their third album the group stopped recording covers. Lennon and 
                                McCartney's songwriting partnership was very important to them, 
                                both financially and creatively; even in 1969, when they were estranged 
                                over business matters and supposedly not on speaking terms, Lennon 
                                brought McCartney his song “The Ballad of John and Yoko” and they 
                                worked together on the “middle eight” (the stand-alone section that 
                                often comes midway in a song). Their music transcended personal 
                                differences.

                                The Beatles ceased playing live shows in 1966. After their breakup 
                                in 1970, McCartney recorded two solo albums, McCartney (1970) and 
                                Ram (1971), before forming the band Wings with his wife Linda 
                                (formerly Linda Eastman), an American photographer and musician 
                                whom he had married in 1969. He wanted her with him at all times, 
                                and having her on stage solved many of the problems that befall 
                                marriages in the world of popular music. Wings toured the world and 
                                became the best-selling pop act of the 1970s, with an astonishing 
                                27 U.S. Top 40 hits (beating Elton John's 25) and five consecutive 
                                number one albums, including the highly acclaimed Band on the Run 
                                (1973) and Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976).

                                McCartney had interests beyond popular music. Inspired by a meeting 
                                with Willem de Kooning in the late 1970s, he began painting, and 
                                by the late 1980s he was devoting much of his time to it. His work 
                                was first shown publicly in May 1999 at a retrospective held in Siegen, 
                                Germany. McCartney branched out in other areas too: his semiautobiographical 
                                classical composition Liverpool Oratorio, written in collaboration with 
                                American composer Carl Davis, was first performed in 1991 by the Royal 
                                Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra at Liverpool's Anglican cathedral, 
                                where McCartney once failed his audition as a choirboy. He subsequently 
                                oversaw the recording of his other classical compositions, including 
                                Standing Stone (1997), Working Classical (1999), and Ecce Cor Meum (2006). 
                                In 2001 a volume of his poetry, Blackbird Singing, which also included 
                                some song lyrics, was published. In addition, he composed the score for Peter 
                                Martins's ballet Ocean's Kingdom (2011). McCartney authored several children's 
                                books, including Hey Grandude! (2019).

                                John Lennon, in full John Winston Ono Lennon, 
                                (born October 9, 1940, Liverpool, England—died December 8, 
                                1980, New York, New York, U.S.), leader or coleader of the 
                                British rock group the Beatles, author and graphic artist, 
                                solo recording artist, and collaborator with Yoko Ono on 
                                recordings and other art projects.

                                Lennon's fun-loving working-class parents married briefly 
                                and late and declined to raise their quick, sensitive, 
                                gifted son. Separated traumatically from each of them by age 
                                five, he was raised strictly (in Woolton, a Liverpool suburb) 
                                by his maternal aunt, Mimi Smith, whose husband died during Lennon's 
                                adolescence, as did his biological mother, who had taught him to 
                                play the banjo. Such circumstances were not uncommon in the wake 
                                of World War II, but in Lennon they generated anger that he 
                                sublimated with brilliance and difficulty and an intense need for 
                                human connection. At age 21 he married the supportive, traditional 
                                Cynthia Powell, whom he divorced in 1968. At age 28 he married the 
                                independent, unconventional Yoko Ono. And much earlier, at age 16, 
                                he founded a skiffle band that evolved into the Beatles, the most 
                                important musical group of the second half of the 20th century.

                                The Beatles were essentially a joint venture between practical 
                                pop adept Paul McCartney and alienated rock-and-roll rebel Lennon, 
                                but, as a disruptive cultural force, they always bore Lennon's 
                                stamp. Musically, just two of countless examples are the forthright 
                                candour his vocal added to Smokey Robinson's vulnerable “You've 
                                Really Got a Hold on Me” in 1964 and the “I used to be cruel to 
                                my woman” bridge he added to McCartney's positive-thinking 
                                “Getting Better” in 1967. Culturally too, Lennon assumed the role 
                                of the candid provocateur. All four Beatles were witty, all four 
                                irreverent. But only Lennon would have observed “We're more popular 
                                than Jesus now” or boiled the story of youth culture down to “America 
                                had teenagers and everywhere else just had people.”

                            <p>
                                Lennon's genius encompassed writing and the visual arts, the only 
                                field in which he received formal training. His natural gifts in both 
                                were considerable, but in the end he proved a minor humorist and a casual 
                                if indelible cartoonist. In music, he had less inborn facility, though his 
                                paternal grandfather worked for years as a blackface minstrel. But music 
                                was where he put his substance. Lennon was one of the great rock rhythm 
                                guitarists, his signature a nervous rest-one-two-and-rest that complicated 
                                his foursquare attack, and his strong, nasal singing overshadowed McCartney's 
                                more physically capable rocking and crooning. Declarative where the 
                                rockabilly singers he admired were frantic, almost a blues shouter in spirit if 
                                not in timbre, Lennon often undercut the masculinity of this approach with a canny, 
                                playful high voice deployed to humorous and even campy effect.
                            </p>

                                His most enduring political commitment was to feminism. 
                                When he and Ono separated in the fall of 1973, he spent a 
                                “lost weekend” of more than a year drinking and making highly 
                                uneven music in Los Angeles. When the couple reunited, they soon 
                                conceived a son, Sean, born on Lennon's birthday in 1975. 
                                Lennon retreated from music and became a reclusive househusband, 
                                leaving his business affairs to Ono. The details of this very private 
                                period are unclear, although it is unlikely that the couple's 
                                domestic arrangements were as idyllic as they pretended. 
                                Nevertheless, as a piece of art, their marriage projected as 
                                powerful an image as their activism had. It ended as fact when 
                                Lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan, Mark David Chapman, 
                                in front of his Manhattan apartment building on December 
                                8, 1980. But it continues as part of Lennon's legend, which 
                                remains undiminished.

                                George Harrison, (born February 25, 1943, Liverpool, 
                                England—died November 29, 2001, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), 
                                British musician, singer, and songwriter, who gained fame 
                                as the lead guitarist of the Beatles, one of the most 
                                important and influential bands in the history of rock music. 
                                Harrison was the youngest of the “Fab Four” and was known as 
                                “the quiet Beatle.” He later achieved singular success as a 
                                songwriter and performer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Harrison was born the youngest of four children in a 
                                working-class family. His father was a steward in the 
                                merchant navy before becoming a bus conductor, and his 
                                mother was a clerk in a grocery store. Harrison began playing 
                                guitar in secondary school. He later met Paul McCartney, 
                                who invited Harrison to join the Quarrymen, the rock band he 
                                and John Lennon had formed. The group underwent several name 
                                and lineup changes before becoming the Beatles and settling on 
                                Harrison as lead guitar, Lennon as vocalist and rhythm guitar, 
                                McCartney as vocalist and bass, and Ringo Starr as drummer.

                            <p>
                                Although Lennon and McCartney wrote and sang most of the songs 
                                the Beatles performed, Harrison also contributed original works, 
                                beginning with “Don't Bother Me” (1963). A few of his later songs 
                                came to be regarded as some of the Beatles' finest, including 
                                “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” (1968), “Here Comes the Sun” 
                                (1969), and “Something” (1969). In 1965 Harrison studied the sitar 
                                with Ravi Shankar and first featured his skills in “Norwegian Wood” 
                                (1965). Harrison's interest in Indian culture grew, and in 1968 he and 
                                the Beatles, as well as a number of other celebrities, explored 
                                transcendental meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India. 
                                The trip influenced dozens of subsequent Beatles songs, but Harrison 
                                was the only member to make these religious practices part of his life.

                                Harrison released his first solo work in 1968 with the soundtrack 
                                to the psychedelic film Wonderwall. Following the breakup of the 
                                Beatles in 1970, he continued to put out solo recordings—notably 
                                the highly successful triple album All Things Must Pass (1970), 
                                which included the memorable “My Sweet Lord.” Other popular songs 
                                included “Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth),” on Living in the 
                                Material World (1973), and “Got My Mind Set on You”, on Cloud Nine 
                                (1987). In 1971 Harrison staged two concerts to raise money to fight 
                                starvation in Bangladesh, which later became the prototype for 
                                star-studded fund-raising events. In 1979 he ventured into film 
                                production as a founder of Handmade Films. Among the company's 
                                efforts were the Monty Python film Life of Brian (1979), Time Bandits 
                                (1981), and Mona Lisa (1986). Harrison was a frequent collaborator and 
                                often appeared on the albums of his former bandmates and other musicians. In the late 1980s he recorded and performed with the Traveling Wilburys, a musical group featuring Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne.

                                After the murder of Lennon in 1980, Harrison maintained a low 
                                public profile. He was attacked in his home by an intruder in 1999
                                but survived with multiple stab wounds. Harrison was also treated 
                                for throat cancer in 1997 and for lung cancer and a brain tumour in 2001. He died at the age of 58 that year.

                                Ringo Starr, byname of Sir Richard Starkey, 
                                (born July 7, 1940, Liverpool, Merseyside, England), 
                                British musician, singer, songwriter, and actor who was 
                                the drummer for the Beatles, one of the most influential 
                                bands in rock history. He also found success in a solo career.
                            </p>

                                Starkey was born in a working-class area of Liverpool. 
                                His parents, both bakery workers, divorced when he was a small child. 
                                Frequently ill, he spent a year in the hospital with complications 
                                from a burst appendix when he was six years old and a further 
                                two years in a sanatorium after he acquired pleurisy at the age of 13. 
                                During the latter episode he was introduced to the drums by a health 
                                worker who gave children musical instruments to amuse them. Starkey 
                                did not return to school after his release from the sanatorium
                                 but worked at various jobs, eventually becoming an 
                                 apprentice joiner for an engineering company, where he and 
                                 other employees formed a skiffle band. In 1959 he became the 
                                 drummer for another skiffle band, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, 
                                 and adopted his stage name. The band became quite popular, and 
                                 it was during a shared 1960 engagement in Hamburg, West Germany, 
                                 that Starr became acquainted with the Beatles (John Lennon, Paul 
                                 McCartney, George Harrison, and Pete Best).

                                In 1962 Starr replaced Best as drummer for the Beatles. 
                                He underpinned the band with a straightforward steady beat 
                                and won over fans with his engaging personality. Though his 
                                vocal skills were limited, he did take the lead on a handful 
                                of songs, including “Boys” on the band's 1963 debut album, 
                                Please Please Me, and its first American release, Introducing 
                                the Beatles (1964); “Honey Don't” on Beatles for Sale in 
                                the United Kingdom and Beatles '65 in the United States 
                                (both 1964); “Act Naturally” on Help! (1965); and “With 
                                a Little Help from My Friends” on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts 
                                Club Band (1967). In the late 1960s Starr began songwriting, 
                                contributing “Octopus's Garden” to Abbey Road (1969).

                                The members of the Beatles had all launched separate 
                                careers before the band officially broke up in 1970. 
                                Starr appeared in films, including The Magic Christian 
                                (1969), and his first two solo albums, Sentimental Journey, 
                                consisting of standards from the 1930s and '40s, and Beaucoups 
                                of Blues, a collection of country music, were both released in 
                                1970. He also had several hit singles during the 1970s, notably 
                                “It Don't Come Easy” (1971), “Back Off Boogaloo” (1972), 
                                and “Photograph” and “You're Sixteen” (both 1973). Starr 
                                continued to release albums and to play on solo records for 
                                Lennon and Harrison, but his successes became more modest as 
                                time went on.

                                In 2015 Starr was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 
                                receiving the Award for Musical Excellence; the Beatles were 
                                inducted in 1988. Starr was made a Member of the Order of the 
                                British Empire (MBE) in 1965, and he received a knighthood in 
                                the 2018 New Year Honours.
