                                <p>
                                    A master musician, a film producer and actor, 
                                    best known as the lead guitarist and occasionally 
                                    lead vocalist of The Beatles, George Harrison was born 
                                    February 25, 1943, in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. He 
                                    was also the youngest of four children, born to Harold Harrison 
                                    and Louise Harrison.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    His influence on the group and pop music in general extended 
                                    beyond just singles. In 1965, while on the set of The Beatles' 
                                    second film, Help! (1965), Harrison took an interest in some of 
                                    the Eastern instruments and their musical arrangements that were 
                                    being used in the film. He soon developed a deep interest in Indian 
                                    music. He taught himself the sitar, introducing the instrument to 
                                    many western ears on Lennon's song, "Norwegian Wood"" He soon 
                                    cultivated a close relationship with renowned sitar player Ravi 
                                    Shankar. Other groups, including The Rolling Stones, began 
                                    incorporating the sitar into some of their work. It could be 
                                    argued that Harrison's experimentation with different kinds 
                                    of instrumentation helped pave the way for such ground-breaking 
                                    Beatle albums as "Revolver" and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".

                                <p>
                                    John Lennon was a British singer-songwriter and a 
                                    key member of the Beatles - a musical and cultural phenomenon. 
                                    After the Beatles, Lennon went on to have a distinguished 
                                    solo career. Lennon was also an icon of the 1960s 
                                    counter-culture revolution and was an anti-war activist.

                                <p>
                                    Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze 
                                    as a teenager. In 1956, he formed The Quarrymen, which evolved 
                                    into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called "the smart Beatle", 
                                    he was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually 
                                    ceded to McCartney. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media 
                                    by participating in numerous films, including How I Won the War, and 
                                    authoring In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both 
                                    collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with 
                                    "All You Need Is Love", his songs were adopted as anthems by the 
                                    anti-war movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969,
                                    he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, the multimedia 
                                    artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-ins 
                                    for Peace, and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career.

                                    Ringo Starr is a British musician, actor, director, 
                                    writer, and artist best known as the drummer of The Beatles 
                                    who also coined the title 'A Hard day's Night' for The Beatles' 
                                    first movie.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ringo's steady and reliable drumming became 
                                    essential in their studio sessions, as well as in 
                                    their numerous and exhausting live performances across 
                                    the world. Ringo's positive disposition as well as his 
                                    drumming style played the pivotal role in shaping the famous 
                                    image and music style of The Beatles as they are now known to 
                                    the world, under the management of Brian Epstein and music producer 
                                    George Martin. Ringo filled the position of a drummer for 
                                    The Beatles in the most critical time of the band's formation. 
                                    He quickly connected with the other three members of The Beatles, 
                                    and contributed to their music and creativity with his easy-going 
                                    personality, light humour, reliable drumming and inventive 
                                    musicianship. All four members were charismatic and individually 
                                    talented artists, they sparked each other from the beginning. 
                                    Eventually they made a much better group effort under the thorough 
                                    management by Brian Epstein whose coaching helped consolidate their 
                                    talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork.

                <h2>From Liverpool to the world</h2>
                <p>
                    Who were the Beatles? Only one of the most popular bands of all time! Most people trace the beginning of the Beatles to Liverpool in 1957. That year, guitarist Paul McCartney met John Lennon. He joined Lennon’s band, then called The Quarrymen. Soon, McCartney and Lennon were joined by guitarist George Harrison. Later, they met drummer Ringo Starr. These four musicians became the band known as the Beatles.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Together, they played local shows and toured Hamburg, Germany. The Beatles released their first single in the U.K., “Please Please Me” in 1963. The song rose to the top of the charts. The next year, over 70 million people watched the Beatles’ American debut on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” This was a popular variety show that hosted other famous musicians, including Elvis Presley and The Supremes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, millions of fans were caught up in what came to be called Beatlemania. The Beatles sold out shows across the U.S. and Europe. Everywhere they went, crowds of thousands awaited them. Young fans screamed their names and waited hours for autographs. The music world had never seen anything like it.
