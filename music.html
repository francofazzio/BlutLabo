                <h1>Their music</h1>
                <p>Throughout their career, the Beatles were associated as composers and
                    performers with musical devices infrequently or never used by other rock musicians. </p>
                <p>As Paul McCartney once put it: “That was the force behind the Beatles: We'd do one song, and it'd be a hit, and instead of doing another with the same formula, we'd say, "OK, we've done that." You listen to the Beatles' output and no two songs are alike.”</p>
                <p>You can find below each of the albums made by The Beatles during their <a href="./about.html#popup3">Studio Years</a>, along with a brief description and their history.</p>

                                    Please Please Me is the debut studio album by the English 
                                    rock band the Beatles. Produced by George Martin, it was 
                                    released on EMI's Parlophone label on 22 March 1963 in the 
                                    United Kingdom, following the success of the band's first two 
                                    singles "Love Me Do", which reached number 17 on the Record 
                                    Retailer Chart, and "Please Please Me", which reached number 
                                    one on the NME and Melody Maker charts. The album topped Record 
                                    Retailer's LP chart for 30 weeks, an unprecedented achievement 
                                    for a pop album at that time.>

                                    First conceived as a live album by Martin in November 1962, 
                                    the recording was moved to the studio but intended to capture 
                                    the sound and repertoire of the Beatles' live performances 
                                    in places like the Liverpool Cavern Club.

                                    Aside from their already released singles, the 
                                    Beatles recorded the majority of Please Please Me in 
                                    one long recording session at EMI Studios on 11 February 
                                    1963, with Martin adding overdubs to "Misery" and "Baby It's You" 
                                    nine days later. Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written 
                                    by the songwriting partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney 
                                    (originally credited "McCartney-Lennon"). Rolling Stone 
                                    magazine later cited these original compositions as early 
                                    evidence of the Beatles' "[invention of] the idea of the 
                                    self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing 
                                    their own instruments". Please Please Me was voted 39th on 
                                    Rolling Stone's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" 
                                    (2012), and number 622 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's

                                    With the Beatles is the second studio album by the English 
                                    rock band the Beatles. It was released in the United Kingdom 
                                    on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone, eight months after the band's 
                                    debut Please Please Me. Produced by George Martin, the album 
                                    features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon-McCartney 
                                    and "Don't Bother Me", George Harrison's first recorded solo 
                                    composition and his first released on a Beatles album) and six 
                                    covers (mostly of rock and roll and Motown R&B hits). The sessions 
                                    also yielded the non-album single, "I Want to Hold Your Hand" 
                                    backed by "This Boy". The cover photograph was taken by the fashion 
                                    photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several 
                                    music groups over the years. A different cover was used for the 
                                    Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased 
                                    with.

                                    n the United States, the album's tracks were unevenly split 
                                    over the group's first two albums released on Capitol Records: 
                                    Meet the Beatles! and The Beatles' Second Album. It was also 
                                    released in Canada under the name Beatlemania! With the Beatles. 
                                    The album was ranked number 420 on Rolling Stone magazine's list 
                                    of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and was included 
                                    in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2010). 
                                    It was also voted number 275 in the third edition of English writer 
                                    Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).

                                    A Hard Day's Night is the first Beatles album to feature entirely original compositions,
                                    and the only one where all the songs were written by Lennon-McCartney.
                                    Lennon is the primary author of nine of the thirteen tracks on the album,
                                    as well as being the lead singer on these same nine tracks.
                                    It is one of three Beatles albums, along with Let It Be and Magical Mystery Tour,
                                    in which Starr does not sing lead vocal on any songs.

                                    The album includes the song "A Hard Day's Night", with its 
                                    distinctive opening chord, and "Can't Buy Me Love", both 
                                    transatlantic number-one singles for the band. Several of 
                                    the songs feature George Harrison playing a Rickenbacker 
                                    12-string electric guitar, a sound that was influential on the 
                                    Byrds and other groups in the folk rock/jangle pop movement.

                                    Beatles for Sale is the fourth studio album by the English 
                                    rock band the Beatles. It was released on 4 December 1964 
                                    in the United Kingdom on EMI's Parlophone label. The album 
                                    marked a departure from the upbeat tone that had characterised 
                                    the Beatles' previous work, partly due to the band's 
                                    exhaustion after a series of tours that had established 
                                    them as a worldwide phenomenon in 1964. Beatles for Sale was 
                                    not widely available in the US until 1987, when the Beatles' 
                                    catalogue was standardised for release on CD. Instead, eight 
                                    of the album's fourteen tracks appeared on Capitol Records' 
                                    concurrent release, Beatles '65, issued in North America only.

                                    Beatles for Sale received favourable reviews in the UK 
                                    musical press, where it held the number one spot for 
                                    11 of the 46 weeks that it spent in the top 20. The album 
                                    was similarly successful in Australia, where the band's cover 
                                    of Berry's "Rock and Roll Music" also topped the singles chart. 
                                    One of the songs omitted from the US version of the album, "Eight 
                                    Days a Week", became the Beatles' seventh number one in the US when 
                                    issued as a single there in February 1965. In 2000, it was voted 
                                    number 204 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 
                                    1000 Albums.

                                    During the recording sessions for the album, the Beatles 
                                    continued to explore the studio's multitracking capabilities 
                                    to layer their sound. "Yesterday" features a string quartet, 
                                    the band's first use of Baroque sensibilities, and "You've 
                                    Got to Hide Your Love Away" includes a flute section. The North 
                                    American release is a true soundtrack album, combining the 
                                    first seven songs with instrumental music from the film. The 
                                    omitted tracks are instead spread across the Capitol Records LPs 
                                    Beatles VI, Rubber Soul and Yesterday and Today.

                                    In the US, Help! marked the start of artistic recognition for 
                                    the Beatles from mainstream critics, including comparisons 
                                    to the European art music tradition. It was nominated in the 
                                    category of Album of the Year at the 1966 Grammys Awards, 
                                    marking the first time that a rock band had been recognised 
                                    in this category. In 2000, it was voted 119th in the third 
                                    edition of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums. 
                                    In 2020, it was ranked 266th on Rolling Stone magazine's 
                                    list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In September 
                                    2013, after the British Phonographic Industry changed its 
                                    sales award rules, Help! was certified platinum for recorded 
                                    sales since 1994.

                                    Rubber Soul is the sixth studio album by the English 
                                    rock band the Beatles. It was released on 3 December 
                                    1965 in the United Kingdom, on EMI's Parlophone label, 
                                    accompanied by the non-album double A-side single "Day Tripper" 
                                    / "We Can Work It Out". The original North American release, 
                                    issued by Capitol Records, contains ten of the fourteen songs 
                                    and two tracks withheld from the band's Help! album. Rubber 
                                    Soul was met with a highly favourable critical response and 
                                    topped sales charts in Britain and the United States for several 
                                    weeks.

                                    The recording sessions took place in London over a four-week 
                                    period beginning in October 1965. For the first time in their 
                                    career, the Beatles were able to record an album free of concert, 
                                    radio or film commitments. Often referred to as a folk rock album, 
                                    particularly in its Capitol configuration, Rubber Soul incorporates 
                                    a mix of pop, soul and folk musical styles. The title derives from 
                                    the colloquialism "plastic soul" and was the Beatles' way of 
                                    acknowledging their lack of authenticity compared to the 
                                    African-American soul artists they admired. After A Hard Day's 
                                    Night in 1964, it was the second Beatles LP to contain only original 
                                    material.

                                    Rubber Soul was highly influential on the Beatles' peers, 
                                    leading to a widespread focus away from singles and onto 
                                    creating albums of consistently high-quality songs. It has 
                                    been recognised by music critics as an album that opened up 
                                    the possibilities of pop music in terms of lyrical and musical 
                                    scope, and as a key work in the creation of styles such as 
                                    psychedelia and progressive rock. Among its many appearances 
                                    on critics' best-album lists, Rolling Stone ranked it fifth 
                                    on the magazine's 2012 list "The 500 Greatest Albums of All 
                                    Time". In 2000, it was voted at number 34 in the third edition 
                                    of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums. The album was 
                                    certified 6x platinum by the RIAA in 1997, indicating shipments 
                                    of at least six million copies in the US. In 2013, Rubber Soul 
                                    was certified platinum by the BPI for UK sales since 1994.

                                    Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock 
                                    band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied 
                                    by the double A-side single "Eleanor Rigby" / "Yellow Submarine". 
                                    The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their 
                                    retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt 
                                    use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of 
                                    their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded 
                                    as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history 
                                    of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical 
                                    styles, diverse sounds, and lyrical content.

                                    The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at 
                                    the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's 
                                    cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the 
                                    group's psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in 
                                    the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing 
                                    themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns. 
                                    With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band 
                                    made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed 
                                    tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard 
                                    live set-up. Among its tracks are "Tomorrow Never Knows", incorporating 
                                    heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; "Eleanor Rigby", a song 
                                    about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and 
                                    "Love You To", a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also 
                                    produced a non-album single, "Paperback Writer" backed with "Rain".

                                    Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio 
                                    album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released on 
                                    26 May 1967, Sgt. Pepper is regarded by musicologists 
                                    as an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound 
                                    composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, 
                                    and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate 
                                    cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous 
                                    touchstones of the era's youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, 
                                    mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. Critics 
                                    lauded the album for its innovations in songwriting, production 
                                    and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular 
                                    music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary 
                                    youth and the counterculture.

                                    At the end of August 1966, the Beatles had permanently retired 
                                    from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three 
                                    months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney 
                                    had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that 
                                    formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. For this project, 
                                    they continued the technological experimentation marked by their 
                                    previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline 
                                    for completion. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with 
                                    compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, but after pressure 
                                    from EMI, the songs "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" 
                                    were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left 
                                    off the LP. The album was then loosely conceptualised as a 
                                    performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was 
                                    conceived after recording the title track.

                                    The Beatles, also known colloquially as the White Album, 
                                    is the ninth studio album and only double album by the 
                                    English rock band the Beatles, released on 22 November 
                                    1968. Featuring a plain white sleeve, the cover contains 
                                    no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed. This 
                                    was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork 
                                    of the band's previous LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 
                                    The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse 
                                    range of genres, including folk, British blues, ska, music hall, 
                                    pre-heavy metal and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed 
                                    by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as among the greatest 
                                    albums of all time.

                                    The album features 30 songs, 19 of which were written 
                                    during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation 
                                    course in Rishikesh, India. There, the only western instrument 
                                    available to the band was the acoustic guitar; several of 
                                    these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles and were recorded 
                                    solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic 
                                    ensured that the album's sound was scaled down and less reliant 
                                    on studio innovation than most of their releases since Revolver 
                                    (1966). The Beatles also broke with the band's tradition at the 
                                    time of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping 
                                    each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.

                                    Yellow Submarine is the tenth studio album by English rock band 
                                    the Beatles, released on 13 January 1969 in the United States 
                                    and on 17 January in the United Kingdom. It was issued as the 
                                    soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered 
                                    in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the 
                                    Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released 
                                    "Yellow Submarine" and "All You Need Is Love". The remainder of 
                                    the album is a re-recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack 
                                    by the band's producer, George Martin.

                                    The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the 
                                    Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. 
                                    Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, 
                                    while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album 
                                    was recorded before - and issued two months after - the band's 
                                    self-titled double LP (also known as the "White Album") and was 
                                    not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing 
                                    only the new songs had been considered, and was mastered, but left 
                                    unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 
                                    compilation Mono Masters.

                                    Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has 
                                    since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some 
                                    of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally 
                                    associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, 
                                    the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th 
                                    anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, 
                                    and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along 
                                    with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed.

                                    Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album released by the 
                                    English rock band the Beatles. It is the last album the 
                                    group started recording, although Let It Be was the last 
                                    album completed before the band's break-up in April 1970. 
                                    It was mostly recorded in April, July and August 1969, and 
                                    was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 
                                    1 October 1969 in the United States, reaching number one in 
                                    both countries. A double A-side single from the album, 
                                    "Something" / "Come Together" was released in October, which 
                                    also topped the charts in the US.

                                    Abbey Road is a rock album that incorporates genres such as 
                                    blues, pop, and progressive rock and makes prominent use of 
                                    the Moog synthesizer and the Leslie speaker. It is also notable 
                                    for having a long medley of songs on side two that have subsequently 
                                    been covered as one suite by other notable artists. The album was 
                                    recorded in a more collegial atmosphere than the Get Back / Let 
                                    It Be sessions earlier in the year, but there were still significant 
                                    confrontations within the band, particularly over Paul McCartney's 
                                    song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", and John Lennon did not perform 
                                    on several tracks. By the time the album was released, Lennon had 
                                    left the group, though this was not publicly announced until 
                                    McCartney also quit the following year.

                                    Although it was an immediate commercial success, it received 
                                    mixed reviews. Some critics found its music inauthentic and 
                                    criticised the production's artificial effects. By contrast, 
                                    critics today view the album as one of the Beatles' best and 
                                    rank it as one of the greatest albums of all time. George Harrison's 
                                    two songs on the album, "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun", 
                                    have been regarded as some of the best he wrote for the group. 
                                    The album's cover, featuring the group walking across a zebra 
                                    crossing outside Abbey Road Studios, has become one of the most 
                                    famous and imitated in the history of recorded music.

                                    Let It Be is the 12th and final studio album by the English 
                                    rock band the Beatles. It was released on 8 May 1970, almost 
                                    a month after the group's break-up, in tandem with the documentary 
                                    of the same name. Concerned about recent friction within the band, 
                                    Paul McCartney had conceived the project as an attempt to 
                                    reinvigorate the group by returning to simpler rock 'n' roll 
                                    configurations. The album topped charts in many countries, 
                                    including both the UK and the US, but the critical response 
                                    was generally unfavourable, and Let It Be came to be regarded 
                                    as one of the most controversial rock albums in history.

                                    Rehearsals began at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969 as 
                                    part of a planned television documentary showing the Beatles' 
                                    return to live performance. The filmed rehearsals were marked by 
                                    ill feeling, leading to George Harrison's temporary departure 
                                    from the group. As a condition of his return, the members 
                                    reconvened at their own Apple Studio, and recruited guest 
                                    keyboardist Billy Preston. The project yielded a single public 
                                    concert held on the studio's rooftop on 30 January, from which 
                                    three of the album's tracks were drawn.

                                    In April 1969, the Beatles issued the lead single "Get Back" 
                                    (backed with "Don't Let Me Down"), after which engineer 
                                    Glyn Johns prepared and submitted mixes of the album - titled 
                                    Get Back and subsequently rejected by the band. The project 
                                    then lay in limbo as they moved onto the recording of Abbey Road, 
                                    released that September. In January 1970, four months after 
                                    John Lennon's departure from the group, the remaining Beatles 
                                    completed "Let It Be" and recorded "I Me Mine". The former was 
                                    issued as the second single from the album in March 1970, and 
                                    like all the albums recording to this point, was produced by 
                                    George Martin.
